Documentaion for Starvation problem:
 The way we chose to deal with the starvation is by moving the the process in lower two queues up by one. For example all of the processes in queue 1 will move up to queue 0
 This occurs every 7 cycles of the while loop.


Documentaion for reading message
For reply and send message the scanf only gets the first 40 characters and discards the rest


Documentation for more than one message
    If process Receives another message while one is still pending then the most recent message will fail a
    and not send, but the sender still gets blocked

Documention for send/reply
   if a process is blocked from a send, then it can only receive from a reply however will still get blocked if it tries
   if a process is blocked from a recieve, then can only receive from a send
   Send also works normally if the process is not in the blocked message queue
   init(does not get blocked)

 Documentation for Semaphores and init
    We chose init to not be allowed to use semaphores, P calls since they cannot be blocked and it would cause problems for the the other process blocked since they will need to wait a extra V call to be unblocked
