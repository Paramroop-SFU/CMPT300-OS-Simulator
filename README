Things to do




Documentaion for Starvation problem:
 The way we chose to deal with the starvation is by moving the the process in lower two queues up by one. For example all of the processes in queue 1 will move up to queue 0
 This occurs every 7 cycles of the while loop.


Documentaion 
For reply and send message the scanf only gets the first 40 characters and discards the rest


 Documentation for more than one message
    If process Receives another message while one is still pending then the most recent message will fail a
    and not send, but the sender still gets blocked

Documention for send/reply
   if a process is blocked from a send, then it can only receive from a reply
   if a process is blocked from a recieve, then can only receive from a send

 Documentation for Semaphores and init
    We chose init to not be allowed to use semaphores, P calls since they cannot be blocked and it would cause problems for the the other process blocked since they will need to wait a extra V call to be unblocked
